## Badanie wp≈Çywu zmiennych demograficznych na dochody w USA [PL]
The project focuses on data visualization using ggplot2 library and income prediction using decision trees.

Used tools:
R - tidyverse, rpart, RMarkdown

The project was created in 2019 when my knowledge of writing clean code was limited, so the code could be a little untidy. Possibly, it could be properly adjusted in the future.
